Tonight was St. Patrick's Day at the [Gwinnett Gladiators](http://www.gwinnettgladiators.com/) hockey game. The ice was green, and the arena was filled with 10,349 screaming fans. But wait! Who's that walking out onto the ice?

That's right, Jennifer was singing solo in front of over 10,000 people at a professional hockey game. Oh yeah, and the Gladiators also won the game 5--1.
